preface:

The word "preface" refers to an introductory statement or essay that
precedes the main text of a book or other written work. A preface
typically provides background information about the author, the
purpose of the work, or the context in which it was written. It may
also include acknowledgments or a dedication.


Conversations:

1. Before we dive into the main topic, let me offer a brief preface to
provide some background information

2. I'd like to preface my comments by saying that I appreciate your
perspective, but I have some concerns about the proposal.
